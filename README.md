<h3>Rules</h3>
<p><em>Guess what?</em> implements a visual guessing game.
  Jigsaw hex-shaped tiles are revealed step by step while
  the guessing takes place. The number of still hidden
  tiles is indicated. It could be used to count as the
  result or value of a successful guess. The earlier a
  correct guess is stated the more points can be scored
  for the round.</p>
<p>Getting a minor hint is performed by clicking or touching
  onto the guessing area. This only reveals another
  tile and the score indicator is decreased.</p>
<p>There is a menu entry <em>Solve</em> to reveal the whole
  picture at once without any decrease on the score indicator.
  In such a case an incorrect guess could be penalized by the
  negative remaining value of the image. The menu entry
  <em>Next</em> will start a new round with
  the next image to guess. If the last image is reached the
  <em>Next</em> menu entry is not working. Instead you can
  choose to <em>Restart</em> the whole game with same images
  again.</p>
<p>Have fun finding out and guess what is depicted on the images...</p>
